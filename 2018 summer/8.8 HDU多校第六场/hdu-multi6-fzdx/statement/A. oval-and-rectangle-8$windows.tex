\begin{problem}{oval-and-rectangle}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{32 megabytes}

Patrick Star found an oval!

The half of longer axes is on the x-axis with length $a$.

The half of shorter axes is on the y-axis with length $b$.

Patrick Star is planning to choose a real number $c$ uniformly randomly from $[0, b]$, Patrick Star will get a rectangle after that:

1. Its four vertexes are on the outline of the oval.

2. Its two sides parallel to coordinate axis.

3. One of its sides is $y = c$.

Patrick Star wants to know the expectations of the rectangle's perimeter.

\InputFile
The first line contain a integer $T$ (no morn than 10), the following is $T$ test case, for each test case :

Each line contains contains two integer a, b ($0 < b < a < 10^5$). Separated by an white space.

\OutputFile

For each test case output one line denotes the expectations of the rectangle's perimeter .

You should keep exactly 6 decimal digits and ignore the remain decimal digits. 

It is guaranteed that the 7-th decimal digit of answer will not be 0 or 9.
